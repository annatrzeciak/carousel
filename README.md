# carousel
In this exercise you will be building a responsive carousel from scratch.  Before you start, please look at the requirements and provide an estimate on how long it would take for you to complete the HTML/SCSS, JavaScript, and debugging.  Once you've provided your estimate, spend up to 4 hours of that time creating the carousel.

###Requirements:
You must use SCSS.  
You must use ES6 JavaScript or TypeScript.  
You can use whatever build tools you want (we use webpack), just make sure your SCSS gets compiled into a minified CSS file and your JS gets run through Babel so it’s cross-browser compatible.  
You may use any framework you wish including VueJS or React (we use VueJS) or no framework at all (Vanilla/jQuery)  
The carousel should match the designs provided above and must be fully responsive and work well on mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
The carousel animations must work in IE11 (our lowest supported browser).  
Do not use any premade javascript slider or carousel components like Slick Slider, Flickity or any jQuery plugins such as "Flexslider" etc.  The javascript for this carousel should be written from scratch.  
The carousel should automatically cycle between slides on a timed interval.  
The carousel must slide horizontally and wrap around in an infinite loop. When advancing to the “next” slide from the final slide, it should still appear to slide in from the right side of the screen.
